MANAGING COOKIES IN EXPRESS
###########################

Parse the COOKIE header and populate req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names.

Since version 1.5.0, the cookie-parser middleware no longer needs to be used for this module to work. This module now directly reads and writes cookies on req/res. 

Using cookie-parser may result in issues if the secret is not the same between this module and cookie-parser. Thus, cookieparser is no longer needed when using express-session.

RESPOND OBJECT

The res.cookie() will set, manipulate or clear cookies.

	res.cookie('username',  'joris', {options})

	res.clearCookie('username')

OPTIONS:

	{expires: new Date(Date.now() + 900000), httpOnly: true, 	secure: true}

expires:	set the cookie expiration date. 

NOTE: If missing, or 0, the cookie is a session cookie

maxAge: 	set the expiry time relative to the current time, in ms

path:		the cookie path. Defaults to /

secure:	hhtps only

signed:	set the cookie to be signed

httpOnly:	only accessible by the server
