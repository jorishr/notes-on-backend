APP/RES.LOCALS
##############

Once this object is set, the value of APP.locals properties persist throughout the life of the application, in contrast with RES.locals properties that are valid only for the lifetime of the request.

You can access local variables in templates rendered within the application. This is useful for application-level data (names, titles, etc.) and helper functions (momentjs). 

Example: make momentjs functions available on all views

	app.locals.moment = require('moment'); 

	In the view file:

		<%= moment(campground.createdAt).fromNow() %> 

Local variables are available in middleware via req.app.locals 
	
	in the middleware function: 
		let month = req.app.locals.moment().month("January");

RES.LOCALS

An object that contains response local variables scoped to the request, and therefore available only to the view(s) rendered during that request / response cycle (if any). Otherwise equal to app.locals
