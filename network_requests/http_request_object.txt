HTTP REQUEST OBJECT PROPERTIES
##############################

req.app	//-> 	holds a reference to the Express app object

req.body	//->	contains the data submitted in the request body

NOTE: must be parsed (body-parser) and/or populated manually before you can access it in express

req.ip	//->	ip from where the request originates

req.path	//->	the URL path of the request

req.query	//-> OBJECT containing all query strings in request

NOTE: Express makes it very easy by populating the req.query.
This object is filled with a property for each query parameter.
If there are no query params, it's an empty object. 

With a for..in loop you can loop through it. for(const key in req.query){}

req.xhr		//->	TRUE if the request is an XMLHttpRequest

req.baseUrl	//-> baseUrl of the request
