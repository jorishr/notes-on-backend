- express, nodemailer, how to use your own mailserver?


HTML EMAILS

Lot's of different EMAIL clients that handle html in a different way means we cannot simply send hmtl + css files. It will have to be compiled into one single message.

EMAIL SERVER: LOCAL SERVER VS CLOUD BASED EMAIL DELIVERY SERVICES

You could handle everything yourself with your own mailserver but that needs to be maintained and is harder to scale. Mailgun and Sendgrid are the most popular options.

HTML TEMPLATES WITH EXPRESS

NOTE: Templating languages you can use ejs, mustache, underscore or handlebars.

The HTML template is a seperate file that will be rendered by EXPRESS server and gets passed into it the variables (data-object) you specify there.


EXPRESS CONFIGURATION

IMPORTANT consideration: When using send.render() in a get or post request the ejs template gets rendered upon each requests. This puts load onto the server, which is fine for showing pages.

But for email templates this is not necessary. You can compile the ejs code upon sever start-up just once, not every time a users signs up or asks for a password reset.

You can do a manual compilation upon start-up and keep that code out of the post/get requests.

	let mailTemplate = fs.readFileSync(
					'/views/email/mail.ejs', 'UTF-8');
	
	let compiledMailTemplate = ejs.compile(mailTemplate);

In the post/get request mailgun/sendgrid

	html: compiledMailTemplate.render({dataObject_to_add})

HTML STYLING IN EMAIL CLIENTS

You cannot use classes nor <style> element. Everything has to be written as inline style which is hard to maintain and a pain to write. 

The solution is to use an inline compiler that allows you write CSS in a seperate CSS file and use GULP to run a task that converts everything into one template file with inline styles defined.

A good example of this approach is ZURB-INK, with generator-zurb-ink (requires bower pacakage manager).

MJML: MAILJET MARKUP LANGUAGE

MJML tags are high-level components that will be translated into responsive HTML by the MJML engine.
